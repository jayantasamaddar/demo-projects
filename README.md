# My background and Why I Got Into Development
I have been a startup founder and Creative Director so I come from a background where I enjoy facing real life problems and finding solutions to those problems in a creative way which ends up converting customer frustrations/pain points to delight. While working for my startup, [Kollab](www.kollablifestyle.com), I was working with business software like the Zoho stack (Zoho One, Zoho CRM, Zoho Books, Zoho Inventory, Zoho Creator), Shopify, Klaviyo and other APIs of shipping providers. 

While building apps for the internal use of the company I realised I have a natural knack for finding the cause of problems and then coming up with solution. So although, I started off light development, modifying with HTMl, CSS, JavaScript and modifying shopify themes, I rapidly progressed to building a Product Lifecycle App on Zoho Creator for the company, as well as build a shipping aggregator solution, that integrated with Shopify (our e-commerce platform), various shipping companies like Delhivery, Shiprocket, Pickrr, Zoho CRM and Zoho Books (our Finance suite) for the internal workings of the company.

**Kollab** still uses both the apps today.
